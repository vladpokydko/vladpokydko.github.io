<p>Hello. My name is Vlad. Few years I worked in IT company as copywriter, editor and newsmaker, but sometimes I was involved in testing and this part of work was most excited.<br> 
Throughout my life I studied different programs that I needed to achieve my goals:<br>
InDesign – when I wanted to publish my book<br>
Cubase – to record and edit poems and songs in audio<br>
Photoshop, Lightroom and Capture One – to edit photos<br>
Premiere Pro – to create videos<br><br>

I'm sure that main purpace of every service, programm or application is to resolve problems and help users to achieve their goals. That's why it's so important to create them usefull, bugless and userfriendly. 
Working as a tester (QC and QA in future) I want to contribute to the future and create some background for other people to make their lives better.<br></p>

<div class="subtitle">English-level</div><br>
I rate my English level as Intermediate, because I don't have enough speaking and writing practice.<br> 
But I have great experience in translation from english to russian and ukrainian languages, often watch specialized videos and read articles in english, because it's much easier to find needed information.<br>

Probably my level isn't enough, but it is temporary. I'm ready tu pull my language level to the required. <br><br>

  
<div class="subtitle">Poetry</div><br>

<div class="subtitle">Life is the fight with yourself</div>

Many years ago I was introverted self-critical person and it limited me a lot.<br>
Step by step I overcame the fear of public speaking at literary evenings. <br>
I greatly increased my communication skills especially working as a photographer.  

And I never stop learning and getting experience. 

Life teaches that there is no "I can't" or "I don't know how..." – <br>
